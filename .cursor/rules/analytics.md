# Analytics Rules

## Analysis Files
- `project-analysis-summary.html` - Consolidated analysis overview
- `gcp-storage-optimization.html` - Storage cost optimization strategies
- `cloud-functions-optimization.html` - Cloud Functions analysis
- `project-analysis-comprehensive.html` - Detailed architecture analysis
- `README.md` - Analysis documentation overview

## GitHub Pages Site
- URL: `https://marcin-wiatr.github.io/aicomm-insp-analytics/`
- Password: `aicomm2025`
- Purpose: Hosted analysis reports and optimization strategies

## Analysis Integration Guidelines
- Reference optimization strategies from analysis documents
- Include cost and performance considerations
- Provide implementation roadmaps with timelines
- Include monitoring and metrics recommendations

## Key Analysis Findings
- 60-70% cost reduction potential ($78-150/month â†’ $26-47/month)
- 15-25% performance improvement potential
- Critical security issues requiring immediate attention
- Improved maintainability through code organization

## Implementation Roadmap
- Phase 1 (Week 1): Critical fixes - 40-50% cost reduction
- Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Performance optimization - 20-30% additional reduction
- Phase 3 (Week 4+): Advanced optimizations - 10-20% additional reduction

## Always Reference
- Link to relevant analysis documents
- Include cost and performance implications
- Provide actionable recommendations with implementation steps
- Consider optimization strategies from analysis
